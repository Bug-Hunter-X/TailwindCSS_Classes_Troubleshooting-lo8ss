# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not applying correctly.

The problem is often due to improper configuration, missing dependencies, or conflicts with other CSS.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run a development server (e.g., `npm run dev`).
4. Observe the rendered component. The styling will not be applied correctly.

**Solution:**
The solution involves ensuring that Tailwind CSS is configured correctly. This includes checking the Tailwind configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`), importing the generated CSS file into the application, and ensuring that the classes are correctly implemented in the component.
